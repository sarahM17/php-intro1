##What are the differences between an array, an associative array and an object?

####An array

#####An array in general is just a range of a particular type of things. <br> An array is a data structure in order to store data of a integer, string etc.

####An associative array

#####An associative Array is an array with a string index where instead of linear storage, each value can be assigned with a specific key.

####An object

#####An Object is an individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. <br> We define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it.
